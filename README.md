# NAVER blogsearch

This repository includes source code for **generating a word cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è** using the **Naver Search API üîç**. The code retrieves search results from Naver blogs, extracts words from titles and descriptions, and creates a word cloud. Users can view the API response in **JSON üìÉ** format as well as the resulting word cloud image in **PNG üñºÔ∏è** format.

Feedback is always welcome :-) üå†

pip install numpy pandas plotly python-dotenv wordcloud konlpy
```

<br />

  Choose and remember one version of the indicated list (e.g. zulu-21.jdk), set the JVM path following the format below.
  ```bash
  JVM_PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/${JVM_VERSION}/Contents/Home/bin/java'
  ```

## Play with demo

Get the Naver blog search data and the wordcloud result with following command.

```bash
python word_cloud.py --query ${QUERY} --filename ${FILE_NAME} --count ${COUNT}
```

- **${QUERY}** is the Naver blog search query. No restriction for the query.
- **${FILE_NAME}** is the name of result files, it is allowed to contains only alphabets and underbar symbol(\_).
- **${COUNT}** is the criteria number of generating word cloud. The words which appeared more thatn COUNT times will be displayed in the word cloud image.

```bash
# example command
python word_cloud.py --query "Ïû¨ÌÖåÌÅ¨" --filename "invest" --count 100
```

The word cloud is generated based on the **title** and the **description** of each contents.
The JSON data from API request and the image of wordcloud will be stored at `data/`.
