# NAVER blogsearch

This repository includes source code for **generating a word cloud ☁️** using the **Naver Search API 🔍**. The code retrieves search results from Naver blogs, extracts words from titles and descriptions, and creates a word cloud. Users can view the API response in **JSON 📃** format as well as the resulting word cloud image in **PNG 🖼️** format.

Feedback is always welcome :-) 🌠

## Play with demo

Get the Naver blog search data and the wordcloud result with following command.

```bash
python word_cloud.py --query ${QUERY} --filename ${FILE_NAME} --count ${COUNT}
```

- **${QUERY}** is the Naver blog search query. No restriction for the query.
- **${FILE_NAME}** is the name of result files, it is allowed to contains only alphabets and underbar symbol(\_).
- **${COUNT}** is the criteria number of generating word cloud. The words which appeared more thatn COUNT times will be displayed in the word cloud image.

```bash
# example command
python word_cloud.py --query "재테크" --filename "invest" --count 100
```

The word cloud is generated based on the **title** and the **description** of each contents.
The JSON data from API request and the image of wordcloud will be stored at `data/`.
